# Try Out Development Containers: Node.js

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with GitHub Codespaces or **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) allows you to quickly create customized, cloud-based development environments accessible [from VS Code](https://aka.ms/vso-dl) or the web. 
> **Note:** While GitHub Codespaces is in limited public beta, please _[request access](https://github.com/features/codespaces/signup) if you have not already._

The [VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension allows you to clone a repository or open any folder mounted into (or already inside) a dev container and take advantage of VS Code's full development feature set. 

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the  Code drop-down menu and select the `Open with Codespaces` option.

1. Select `+ New codespace` at the bottom on the pane. This will create a fork of this repository under your account and your codespace will open in a new tab.

### VS Code Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "Node" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

    Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "node"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `server.js`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features. 
   - Notice that `eslint` and the `vscode-eslint` extension are already installed in the container since the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` lists `"dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"` as an extension to install automatically when the container is created.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `server.js`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 20).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   - Continue and from the notification that is shown open a browser. Note you can connect to the server in the container. 
   - The status line shows '1 Port Available'. Clicking the status bar entry shows the 'Ports' view that lists the currently available ports.
4. **Rebuild or update your container** (*Currently, only containers with the VS Code Remote - Containers extension can be rebuilt.*)

   You may want to make changes to your container, such as installing a different version of a software or forwarding a new port. You'll rebuild your container for your changes to take effect. 
   
   **Forward a port statically:** As an example change, let's forward a port statically in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file. 
     
   > **Note:** Remote-Containers and Codespaces also take care of dynamic port forwarding, but there may be instances in which we want to statically declare a forwarded port. 
   
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Uncomment the `forwardedPorts` attribute and adjust the port number as needed.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.

# Try Out Development Containers: Node.js

This is a sample project to go along with the "try" quick start for the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension.

**If you aren't already following the quick start, [see here](#setting-up-the-development-container).**

## Things to try

One you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Some things to try:

1. **Use a Terminal to install needed dependencies:**
   1. Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> to open a terminal window
   2. Type `yarn install`
   3. The command will run even if you don't have yarn installed locally!
2. **Edit:**
   1. Open `server.js`
   2. Try adding some code and check out the language features.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   1. Open `sever.js`
   2. Add a breakpoint.
   3. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   4. Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   5. Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` and note you can connect to the server in the container.
4. **Forward another port:**
   1. Stop debugging
   2. Open `sever.js`
   3. Change the server port to 5000. (`const PORT = 5000;`)
   4. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   5. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Remote-Containers: Forward Port...** command.
   6. Select port 5000.
   7. Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to get set up.

2. If you're not yet in a development container:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Container: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   3. Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!


3. **[Windows]** Disable automatic line ending conversion for Git on the *Windows side* (given Linux and Windows use different line endings). Run: `git config --global core.autocrlf false`
4. Follow the steps at [https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).
5. Run `yarn install`
6. Launch the application, edit, and try things out!
